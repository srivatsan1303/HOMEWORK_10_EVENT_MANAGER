## THINGS LEARNED DURING THE ASSIGNMENT

Throughout this assignment, I've deepened my technical prowess and gained valuable insights into the intricacies of API development and software testing. My understanding of REST APIs has been significantly enriched, enabling me to design and implement more sophisticated solutions. Additionally, I've honed my skills in documenting and testing software thoroughly using tools like pytest. This hands-on experience with rigorous testing methodologies ensures the reliability and robustness of the software, underscoring the importance of quality assurance in software development.

Navigating through specific challenges during this project has sharpened my problem-solving abilities. While debugging complex issues posed initial frustrations, overcoming them independently has been an enlightening process. This solo problem-solving experience not only deepened my technical understanding but also enhanced my adaptability and resilience. The assignment has been pivotal in refining my technical skills and providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in API development and software testing.
